There are a lot of raw circuit board hacker/prototype devices with headphone jack audio outputs.
Devices to [play songs](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/11029),
to [speak words](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/11711),
to [analyze sounds](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/10306),
and [many similar devices](https://github.com/cjdaly/shamp/wiki/SimpleAudioParts) for numerous audio applications.

I wanted to build a system that mixed the outputs of several of these devices.
I looked for a simple 'Sparkfun-caliber' hacker-ish bare circuit board audio mixer without success.
Here are some things I did find:

* [Urban DJ](http://www.cratekings.com/urban-dj-portable-mixtape-cassette-mixer/) - discontinued?
* [iRig MIX](http://www.ikmultimedia.com/products/irigmix/) - big, requires external power
* [failed Kickstarter](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/132274466/wi-fi-audio-mixer-control-with-smartphones-and-tab) - interesting WiFi feature
* [failed Kickstarter](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/pepperdecks/pepperdecks-djoclate-ii-pocket-size-music-mixer-0) - simple with nice finish
* [Instructables DIY project](http://www.instructables.com/id/Altoids-Tin-18-Stereo-Mixer/?ALLSTEPS) - classic Altoids tin casing

After reading the Instructables article linked above, I looked for a set of parts that I could use to build something like the Altoids tin mixer.  One key piece I found is the [Papilio Audio Wing](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/11568) which has 2 audio jacks, seemingly reasonable resistors, and breakouts for the [TRS](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phone_connector_(audio)) audio wires. I combined this with several other Sparkfun parts to produce my first working SHAMP device.
